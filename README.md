# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Map-Viz-of-Tweets-
This project “Prognostication of Box Office Talk using Twitter Corpus” predicts the success of the movie using state of mind of the people that could possibly be achieved by sentiment analysis. The analysis is done with Naive Bayes Classifier which is a supervised text classification algorithm attaining 81 percent of F-Score. This work is also incorporated with visualization of data in R language which stands one among the best in representing the analysis in pictorial format and a map visualization that portrays the location of the tweets with the user name where it has come from.

The Bayesian classification is used as a probabilistic learning method (Naive Bayes text classification). Hence, Naive Bayes classifier is one among the most successful known algorithms to classify text documents.
