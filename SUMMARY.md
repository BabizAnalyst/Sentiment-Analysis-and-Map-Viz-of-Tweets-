**1. Accuracy of 86% achieved for "Naive Bayes Model"**

* Na√Øve Bayes Model is well trained and implemented to attain a overall accuracy of 86% that was achieved by splitting up the training 
and testing set in a ratio of 7:3 as learnt from the coursera machine learning course. 

**2. Training (70%) and Testing (30%)**

* A total of 10944 rows of text were made to undergo training and testing out of which 7660 rows of text were used for training and 
3284 rows of text were used for testing. I attained this accuracy after days of training started from few sets of data, gradually 
increased and ultimately ended up with this result. 

**3.  Quality of data**

* Quality (structure) of data is also one factor that determines the accuracy of the model. Accuracy can be attained even more 
by increasing the data set for training. 

**4.  Usefulness of the proposed work**

* People would find this proposed work, an application helpful as it crunches the huge opinions of tweeple about the movie in numbers and emotions that reflect the state of mind of the tweeple.
